About dataset

A student depression dataset typically contains data aimed at analysing, understanding, and predicting depression levels among students. It may include features such as demographic information (age, gender), academic performance (grades, attendance), lifestyle habits (sleep patterns, exercise, social activities), mental health history, and responses to standardized depression scales.
These datasets are valuable for research in psychology, data science, and education to identify factors contributing to student depression and to design early intervention strategies. Ethical considerations like privacy, informed consent, and anonymization of data are crucial in working with such sensitive information.

Conclusion

Here we utilized different calculations to describe the student depression dataset. The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy score of 84.5%, while the Random Forest model performed slightly lower with an accuracy score of 83.8%. Although both models performed well, the Logistic Regression model slightly outperformed Random Forest in terms of accuracy. This suggests that Logistic Regression might be a better choice for this particular problem, but further testing and tuning could potentially improve both models.This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used effectively to gain insights and make predictions, with opportunities for future enhancements.
